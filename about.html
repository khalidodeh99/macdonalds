      <h2><dt>Our History</dt></h2>
      <dd>
        From drive-thru restaurants to Chicken McNuggets to college credits from
        Hamburger U, we’ve had quite a journey. And we’re still going. But to
        take a look into our past, we need to share the story of one man.

      <h2><dt>The Ray Kroc Story</dt></h2>
      <dd>
        How do you create a restaurant business and become an overnight success
        at the age of 52? As Ray Kroc said, “I was an overnight success alright,
        but 30 years is a long, long night.”
      </dd>
      <br />
      <h2><dt>Origins</dt></h2>
      <dd>
        In 1917, 15-year-old Ray Kroc lied about his age to join the Red Cross
        as an ambulance driver, but the war ended before he completed his
        training. He then worked as a piano player, a paper cup salesman and a
        Multimixer salesman. In 1954, he visited a restaurant in San Bernardino,
        California that had purchased several Multimixers. There he found a
        small but successful restaurant run by brothers Dick and Mac McDonald,
        and was stunned by the effectiveness of their operation. The McDonald’s
        brothers produced a limited menu, concentrating on just a few items –
        burgers, fries and beverages – which allowed them to focus on quality
        and quick service. They were looking for a new franchising agent and
        Kroc saw an opportunity. In 1955, he founded McDonald’s System, Inc., a
        predecessor of the McDonald’s Corporation, and six years later bought
        the exclusive rights to the McDonald’s name and operating system. By
        1958, McDonald’s had sold its 100 millionth hamburger.

      <br />
      <h2><dt>A Unique Philosophy</dt></h2>
      <dd>
        Ray Kroc wanted to build a restaurant system that would be famous for
        providing food of consistently high quality and uniform methods of
        preparation. He wanted to serve burgers, fries and beverages that tasted
        just the same in Alaska as they did in Alabama. To achieve this, he
        chose a unique path: persuading both franchisees and suppliers to buy
        into his vision, working not for McDonald’s but for themselves, together
        with McDonald’s. He promoted the slogan, “In business for yourself, but
        not by yourself.” His philosophy was based on the simple principle of a
        3-legged stool: one leg was McDonald’s franchisees; the second,
        McDonald’s suppliers; and the third, McDonald’s employees. The stool was
        only as strong as the three legs that formed its foundation. “If I had a
        brick for every time I’ve repeated the phrase Quality, Service,
        Cleanliness and Value, I think I’d probably be able to bridge the
        Atlantic Ocean with them.” – Ray Kroc

      <br />
      <h2><dt>Hamburger University</dt></h2>
      <dd>
        In 1961, Kroc launched a training program, later called Hamburger
        University, at a new McDonald’s restaurant in Elk Grove Village,
        Illinois. There, franchisees were trained on the proper methods for
        running a successful McDonald’s restaurant. Hamburger U utilized a
        research and development laboratory in nearby Addison, Illinois to
        develop new cooking, freezing, storing and serving methods. Today, more
        than 275,000 franchisees, managers, and employees have graduated from
        the program.
      </dd>
      <br />
      <h2><dt>The Legend Lives On</dt></h2>
      <dd>
        Right up until he died on January 14, 1984, Ray Kroc never stopped
        working for McDonald’s. His legacy continues to this day, providing
        McDonald’s customers with great tasting, affordable food; crew and
        franchisees with opportunities for growth; and suppliers with a shared
        commitment to provide the highest quality ingredients and products. From
        his passion for innovation and efficiency, to his relentless pursuit of
        quality, to his many charitable contributions, Ray Kroc’s legacy
        continues to be an inspirational and integral part of McDonald'’'s –
        today and into the future.
